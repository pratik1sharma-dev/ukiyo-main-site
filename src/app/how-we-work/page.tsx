            At Ukiyo Habitat, our design process begins with curiosity. We start by listening to the land itself‚Äîto the lone Peepal tree in a concrete jungle, or the memory of a drying lake. This is where our questions begin.

                Every brief becomes an opportunity to challenge assumptions. In a landscape marked by increasing urbanization and shrinking green spaces, we adapt to local ecology and co-create spaces that evolve with changing climates, communities, and contexts.

                From designing sponge landscapes to combat water scarcity in Chennai to creating a campus that breathes life back into its local environment in Central India, our work is driven by inquiry ‚Äî not repetition.

In cities often starved of safe and inclusive public spaces, and visually cluttered by intrusive out-of-home advertising, we use co-design workshops and conversations to build shared ownership of the process.
